Problem One Answers

1. Explain how stringcmp works. [5 points]

		The command "stringcmp" is being used in the program makeLED.c to check the first argument being input into the script. If the first argument
		matches any of the conditions for the script, it will pass through the if statement corresponding to that condition. In a general sense,
		"stringcmp" is used to compare two strings, passing a boolean value of 1 or 0 depending on if they match or not.

2. Explain the statement: FILE* fp; [5 points]

		The statement "FILE* fp;" is used to define the pointer "fp" with the type "FILE", which allows the pointer to store information about the 
		file. This lets the pointer fp be used for file commands, such as "fopen()" and "fclose()".


3. Explain how sprintf works. [5 points]

		The command "sprintf" is being used in the program makeLED.c to print the path and filename to the string "fullfilename". This is being done
		so that the string "fullfilename" can be referenced to call the file as opposed to typing out the whole string every time it needs to be 
		referenced. In general, this command will send any string to a string variable as opposed to displaying it in the console.

4. Explain how fprintf works. [5 points]

		The command "fprintf" is being used in the program makeLED.c to print the value input when running the writeLED function to the file. 
		In general, this command will send any string to a FILE variable as oppsoed to displaying it in the console.

5. Explain how fgets works. [5 points]

		The command "fgets" is being used in the program makeLED.c to retrieve the status of the LED. This is done via string because the value is stored		 in a text file and output to the console. In general, this command will retrieve a string from a file.
